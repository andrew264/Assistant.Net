## Getting Started

To run your own instance of Assistant.Net, you'll need to follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

*   .NET 9 SDK (or the version specified in `Assistant.Net.csproj`)
*   A running Lavalink server for music functionality.
*   A MongoDB database for storing data.
*   A Discord Bot Token and various API keys.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/andrew264/Assistant.Net.git
    cd Assistant.Net
    ```

2.  Configure the bot by creating your own `config.yaml` file. You can start by copying the `example.yaml`:
    ```sh
    cp Configuration/example.yaml Configuration/config.yaml
    ```

3.  Fill in the `Configuration/config.yaml` with your own tokens, keys, and database credentials. See the Configuration section below for more details.

4.  Build and run the project:
    ```sh
    dotnet run
    ```

The bot's behavior is controlled by the `Configuration/config.yaml` file. Here are the main sections you'"'"'ll need to set up:

*   **client**: Contains essential Discord bot settings like the token, owner ID, command prefix, and the category for DM relay channels.
*   **mongo**: Your MongoDB connection details. You can use a full connection string or provide the username, password, and URL separately.
*   **lavalink**: Credentials for your Lavalink server, which is required for all music features.
*   **reddit**: API credentials for a Reddit application if you want to use the Reddit commands. You can also configure the subreddits for the meme and NSFW commands here.
*   **geniusToken**: An API token from Genius for fetching song lyrics.
*   **loggingGuilds**: Configure channels where the bot should log server events like message edits, deletions, and member updates.
